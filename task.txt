You will remain the owner of these sources. This is not a commercial application.

We believe this is a few hours of work. We only invite a few people to do this, only those we really like based on their high level profile.

If you do not have Vue.js in your stack, it might take you a bit longer. Please let me know how you feel about doing this test?
